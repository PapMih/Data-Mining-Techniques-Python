# Data-Mining-Techniques-Python

This project was developed as part of the MSc  course Big Data Mining Techniques.
It focuses on applying various data mining and machine learning methods using Python, scikit-learn.
The work is divided into three parts: text classification, nearest neighbor search, and time series similarity.
In the first part, we implemented Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forest models to classify news articles into categories using a Bag-of-Words representation and evaluated their performance through 5-Fold Cross Validation.
The second part involves improving the efficiency of K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) by applying Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) with MinHash and Jaccard Similarity, comparing execution time and retrieval accuracy against the brute-force approach.
In the final part, we implemented the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm from scratch to measure the similarity between time series of different lengths, focusing on computation time and accuracy.
